'The IVariantComparator provides a method, compare, that imposes a total ordering over a collection _
of variants. A class that implements IVariantComparator, called a Comparator, can be passed to the _
Arrays.sort and Collections.sort methods to precisely control the sort order of the elements.

'Compares two variants for their sort order. Returns -1 if v1 should be sorted ahead of v2; +1 if _
v2 should be sorted ahead of v1; and 0 if the two objects are of equal precedence. This function _
should exhibit several necessary behaviors: _
  1.) compare(x,y)=-(compare(y,x) for all x,y _
  2.) compare(x,y)>= 0 for all x,y _
  3.) compare(x,y)>=0 and compare(y,z)>=0 implies compare(x,z)>0 for all x,y,z
